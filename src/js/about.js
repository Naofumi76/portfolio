		<h1>About Me</h2>
		<div class="about-content">
			<p class="about-me1">
				I'm a full-stack developer who loves to create web applications and tools using Python, Golang, and JavaScript for example. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
			</p>
		
			<p class="about-me2">
				At my school, Zone01 Rouen, I explored languages and tools like Golang, JavaScript, and GraphQL, while independently diving into Python, SQL, and Django. I also have experience with Rust, SQLite3, and HTML/CSS. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to grow as a developer.
			</p>

			<p class="about-me3">
				What inspired me to become a developer was trying to modify the video games I played as a child. While game development is a different world compared to other type of development, it was the challenge of understanding how to make something work that really got me into coding.
