			<h1>Zone01</h1>
			<p>
			Zone01 is a private school at the Campus St Marc located in Rouen that offers a course to become a full-stack developer.
			The program consists of multiple "piscines" and exercises. Each piscine is designed to help us understand and learn the basics of a language
 			(such as Golang, JavaScript, and Rust), while the exercises consist of projects that are real-world applications of the language we learned.
			</p>

			<p>
			The program at this school is peer-to-peer, meaning that there are no professors to teach us. Instead, we have to learn independently as students.
			There are projects for both individual students and groups of two to eight students.
			</p>

			<p> 
			Projects are both interesting and important because they are real exercises that introduce us to work. Projects include creating a forum, making an ant farm simulator, a social network, etc.
			</p>

			<p> 
			At the end of the course, I will obtain an RNCP Level 6 title, officially recognized by the French Government. This title represents 90 European Credits, equivalent to 3 years of education.
